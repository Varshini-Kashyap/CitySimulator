#cursor rules for city simulator

- Read relevant files, images or URLs before writing any code.
Provide either general pointers ("read the file that handles logging") or 
specific filenames ("read logging.py").
- Build a plan and then discuss and review the plan before proceeding.
-  Write tests before implementing and then ensure that the implemented logic passes the tests (test driven 
development)

- Use test driven development:
1. Write tests first
2. Ensure the logic is implemented to make tests pass.
3. Confirm all tests are green before moving on.

#Code style and architecture
- Follow react best practices with functional components only.
-Use Zustand for state management (no redux).
- Use Tailwind CSS + Radix UI for styling and UI components.
- Use TypeScipt everywhere; avoid plain Javascript.
- Keep the simulation engine modular with ES6 imports/exports.

#Documentation and Quality
- Add JSDoc comments for all functions, classes and managers.
- Ensure type safety with proper TypeScript interfaces.
-Prioritize readability and maintainability over clever code.

#testing
- Use Jest and React testing library for all tests.
- Place tests in a 'Test_Files' directory near related modules.
- Mock external services when possible to keep tests fast.

# Project specific rules
- Rendering must maintain 60fps performance.
- Do not introduce external state libraries other than Zustand.
- Infrastructure economy , weather, and happiness logic must remain modular and in separate managers.
